# Introduction to R in RStudio

## RStudio

**Create a new project in RStudio**

-   Go to **File**
-   Choose **New Project**
-   Choose **New Directory** \>\> **New Project**
-   Type in **Directory Name**
-   Choose **Directory** you want to save
-   Click **Create Project**

**Why do this?**

-   proper project management
-   no directory set up required
-   good practice

**Let's practice!**

\newpage

## Packages (modules)

-   Many packages in R to add/use functionality of your interest
    -   **tidyverse** \>\> data management and processing
    -   **magrittr** \>\> facilitate R code workflow `%>%`
    -   **readxl** \>\> read excel files
    -   **janitor** \>\> clean variable names and tabulate data
    -   **rmarkdown** \>\> create documents and reports
    -   **flextable** \>\> create publication-ready tables
    -   **flexDashboard** \>\> for dashboard creation
    
    
``` R
packages_required <- c("tidyverse", "magrittr", "janitor", "readxl", 
    "gtsummary", "flextable")
are_packages_installed <- packages_required %in% installed.packages()

if (!all(are_packages_installed)) {
    packages_required <- packages_required[!are_packages_installed]
    install.packages(packages_required)
}
```

## Functions

-   R is powerful because of functions.
-   To use a function, 2 parts
    -   name \>\> to call the function
    -   arguments \>\> input + instructions
        -   mandatory
        -   optional

``` r
mean(x = input)
```

`x` is mandatory to feed into the function.

``` r
mean(x = input, na.rm = TRUE)
```

`na.rm` is optional, and used when you want to remove missing values from calcultion.

## %\>%

-   pipe operator
-   from `magrittr` package
-   create workflows for writing R codes

``` r
## It pushes the output from left hand side as input to the right hand side. 
left hand side %>% right hand side 
```

Here is an example.

```{r echo=TRUE}
mtcars %>% 
    summarize(avg_speed = mean(mpg))
```

This code chunk works in two stages:

1.  we push a dataset `mtcars` from the left hand side of `%>%` as input to the right hand side.
2.  here, we use `summarize` function from `tidyverse` package. The argument is in the form of `variable_name` = `what you want to do`.

If you use R's default code, you will have to write as follow which gives the same result.

```{r echo=TRUE}
mean(mtcars$mpg)
```

**Where does `mtcars` come from?** `mtcars` is a built-in dataset that comes with R.

## Use codes as template

-   don't remember these codes by heart
-   use codes that work as templates
-   learn how to copy and paste codes

For example, we can replace `mpg` with other variables in `mtcars`.

```{r echo=TRUE}
mtcars %>% 
    summarize(avg_weight = mean(wt))
```

You can add more variables.

```{r echo=TRUE}
mtcars %>% 
    summarize(avg_speed = mean(mpg),
              sd_speed = sd(mpg),
              avg_weight = mean(wt), 
              sd_weight = sd(wt))
```

## Help

So how do you know what to write?

Use `?function_name` to read its help page. But, it is mostly technical and hard to understand because nerds write them for nerds.

``` r
?mean
?sd
?`%>%`
?mtcars
```

## Exercises

-   use a function called `str` to display all variable names in `mtcars`.
    -   how many variables and observations does `mtcars` have?
-   use the remaining variables to summarize their means and standard deviations.

### Answers

``` r
?str 
str(mtcars)
```

# SARS-COV-2 data - PNGIMR

The raw data `png_covid19_2021.xls` received in MS excel format is already processed and saved as `covid.RData`.

R scripts used for data management are stored under the folder `scripts`. if you want to examine the codes in detail, open `main.R` under `scripts` along with `00_setup.R` and `01_data_process.R`.

-   `main.R` compiles the other two scripts.
-   `00_setup.R` provides necessary setup to run all R scripts.
-   `01_data_process.R` is the file where all data management processes happen.

## Clean your workspace

Before you start a new session, use the following code to clean your workspace.

``` r
rm(list = ls())
```

## Data import

The following codes show how to import excel files into R. We use `read_excel()` function from the `readxl` package.

``` r
covid <- readxl::read_excel("data/png_covid19_2021.xls")
```

For the purpose of this workshop, we will use `covid.RData` which was already created for you.

``` r
load("data/covid.RData")
```

## Data dictionary

Name of the data: `covid_processed`

| No  | Variable Name   | Description                                            |

# Descriptive Statistics

## Numerical summary

-   mean and standard deviations
-   median and interquartile range
-   minimum and maximum

**Distributions**

![](images/distributions.jpg){width="600"}

a.  normal distribution
b.  right-skewed because tail is on the right side. If tail is on the left side, it's called left-skewed distribution.
c.  normal distribution with a narrow peak
d.  bimodal distribution

If your data follows normal distribution, use mean and standard deviation. Otherwise, use median and interquartile range.

### Exercises

- Summarize `patient_age` and `time_onset_test`. 
- Which numerical summary measures should we use for `time_onset_test`. 
- In your free time, try `dose_num` and `symp_number`.

Tips: use an optional argument `na.rm = TRUE` because some variables contains missing values.  

\newpage

### Answers 

```{r}
## import data if not done yet. 
load("data/covid.RData")

## load packages 
library(magrittr)
library(tidyverse)

## summarizing covid-19 data 
covid_processed %>% 
    summarise(mean_age = mean(patient_age, na.rm = TRUE), 
              sd_age = sd(patient_age, na.rm = TRUE), 
              mean_time = mean(time_onset_test, na.rm = TRUE), 
              sd_time = sd(time_onset_test, na.rm = TRUE))
```

* For `patient_age`, sd value is less than mean value. It seems like a normal distributioh. 
* For `time_onset_test`, sd value is greater than mean value, suggesting a skewed distribution. We must use median and interquartile range for a robust summary measure. 

```{r}
## summarizing covid-19 data 
covid_processed %>% 
    summarise(mean_time = mean(time_onset_test, na.rm = TRUE), 
              sd_time = sd(time_onset_test, na.rm = TRUE), 
              median_time = median(time_onset_test, na.rm = TRUE), 
              q1_time = quantile(time_onset_test, probs = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE), 
              q3_time = quantile(time_onset_test, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE))
```

As you can see, mean value is quite far right from the median value. This is a right-skewed distribution. 


## Visualization of numerical data 

* histogram 
* boxplot 
* density plot 
* dot plot 
* steam and leaf plot 

### Histogram 

* Histograms are barplots without gaps between bars. 
* bin width is important to shape the distribution. 

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
    ggplot(aes(mpg)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 5) +
    theme_classic() 

mtcars %>% 
    ggplot(aes(mpg)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
    theme_classic() 
```


### Boxplot 

Boxplot shows median, interquartile range, lower and upper whiskers (limits), minimum and maximum values. 

```{r fig.width=3}
mtcars %>% 
    ggplot(aes(mpg)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    coord_flip() + 
    theme_classic()
```


### Exercises 

* Create histograms for `patient_age` and `time_onset_test`. 
* What do you notice with histogram for `time_onset_test`? 
* How would you deal with outliers? 

\newpage

### Answers 

```{r}
covid_processed %>% 
    ggplot(aes(patient_age)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    coord_flip() + 
    theme_classic()
covid_processed %>% 
    ggplot(aes(time_onset_test)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    coord_flip() + 
    theme_classic()
```

In the second histogram, there are several outlier values. On a closer look, negative time in days are not possible and for a covid-19 test, symptoms that occured more than a month ago might not be relevant for our study. 

```{r}
## remove time_onset_test with negative values or values more than 30 days
covid_processed %>% 
    filter(time_onset_test >= 0 & time_onset_test <= 30) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(time_onset_test)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    coord_flip() + 
    theme_classic()
```

You can combine two graphs using `plot_grid()` function from `cowplot` package.

```{r}
## Commented out, we don't call this
library(cowplot)

## histogram for patient_age
plot_age <- covid_processed %>% 
    ggplot(aes(patient_age)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    ggtitle("Patient's age in years") +
    coord_flip() + 
    theme_classic()

## histogram for time_onset_test
plot_time <- covid_processed %>% 
    filter(time_onset_test >= 0 & time_onset_test <= 30) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(time_onset_test)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    ggtitle("Time in days from onset to test") +
    coord_flip() + 
    theme_classic()

## combine two graphs 
plot_grid(plot_age, plot_time, labels = "AUTO")
```



## Tabulation of categorical data 

* frequency tabulation 

Let's use `tbl_summary` function from `gtsummary` package.

Here is the frequency tabulation for
```{r}
covid_processed %>% 
    tabyl(patient_sex) %>% 
    adorn_totals("row") %>%
    adorn_pct_formatting()
```

### Exercises 

* Try tabulating the other categorical variables in `covid_processed`. 

\newpage

### Answers 

Individual tabulations of all categorical variables will be skipped. Instead, a short version using `lapply` is shown below. Using `lapply` is advanced R topic and out of scope for this workshop.

```{r}
covid_processed %>% 
    select(rt_pcr_pos_neg, patient_sex:symp_number) %>% 
    lapply(tabyl)
```

## Barplots 

* Use horizontal barplot if there are more than five categories. 

Here is a barplot of patient's sex displaying counts.
```{r}
covid_processed %>% 
    ggplot(aes(patient_sex)) + 
    geom_bar() + 
    theme_classic() 
```

Here is a barplot of patient's sex displaying percentage.

```{r}
covid_processed %>% 
    ggplot(aes(patient_sex)) + 
    geom_bar(aes(y = ..count.. / sum(..count..))) + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) + # this add percent sign to the axis
    theme_classic() 
```

\newpage 

## Creating Table 1 

It is usually a daunting process to create publication-ready tables in any software. R is no exception. 

We will use and `gtsummary` package to facilitate this process. It is a fully developed package and will take times to use its functions with ease. 

```{r}
covid_processed %>% 
    tbl_summary()
```

We can add options to customize the table. 

```{r}
covid_processed %>% 
    tbl_summary(
        statistic = list(
            time_onset_test ~ "{median} ({p25}, {p75})" # "{mean} ({sd})" 
        ), 
        digits = all_continuous() ~ 1,
        label = list(
            patient_age = "Age in years", 
            patient_sex = "Sex", 
            p_province = "Province", 
            symptom_status = "Symptomatic", 
            symp_number = "Number of symptoms", 
            vaccine_status = "Vaccination status", 
            dose_num = "Number of doses received", 
            case_contact = "History of contact with case", 
            travel_hist = "Travel history", 
            rt_pcr_pos_neg = "RT-PCR", 
            time_onset_test = "Time in days from onset to test"
        ),
        missing = "ifany", ## set to "no" to remove missing values  
        missing_text = "(Missing)") 
```

# Relationship between two variables 

* categorical ~ categorical \>\> cross-tabulation (contigency table)
* categorical ~ numerical \>\> grouped (stratified) summary measures 
* numerical ~ numerical \>\> pearson's correlation (**r**)

## categorical ~ categorical

```{r}
covid_processed %>% 
    tabyl(patient_sex, rt_pcr_pos_neg) %>%  
    adorn_totals(c("row", "col")) %>% 
    adorn_percentages("row") %>% 
    adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1, affix_sign = FALSE) %>%
    adorn_ns("front")

covid_processed %>% 
    ggplot(aes(rt_pcr_pos_neg, fill = patient_sex)) + 
    geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
    theme_classic()
```

### Exercises 

* Check bivariate analysis between RT-PRC positivity and other categorical variables. 

\newpage 

### Answers 

We will use `plot_grid` from `cowplot` package to minimize page numbers. Here we need to change data type of `rt_pcr_pos_neg` to factor, just to tell R to treat it like categorical data. 
We will also do this to other variables that contain numeric values. 

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=8}
plot_grid(
    covid_processed %>% 
        ggplot(aes(factor(rt_pcr_pos_neg), fill = p_province)) + 
        geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
        theme_classic() + 
        theme(legend.position = "bottom"), 
        
    covid_processed %>% 
        ggplot(aes(factor(rt_pcr_pos_neg), fill = symptom_status)) + 
        geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
        theme_classic() + 
        theme(legend.position = "bottom"), 
    
    covid_processed %>% 
        ggplot(aes(factor(rt_pcr_pos_neg), fill = factor(symp_number))) + 
        geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
        theme_classic() + 
        theme(legend.position = "bottom"), 
    
    covid_processed %>% 
        ggplot(aes(factor(rt_pcr_pos_neg), fill = factor(vaccine_status))) + 
        geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
        theme_classic() + 
        theme(legend.position = "bottom"), 
    
    covid_processed %>% 
        ggplot(aes(factor(rt_pcr_pos_neg), fill = factor(dose_num))) + 
        geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
        theme_classic() + 
        theme(legend.position = "bottom"), 
    
    covid_processed %>% 
        ggplot(aes(factor(rt_pcr_pos_neg), fill = factor(case_contact))) + 
        geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
        theme_classic() + 
        theme(legend.position = "bottom"), 
    
    covid_processed %>% 
        ggplot(aes(factor(rt_pcr_pos_neg), fill = factor(travel_hist))) + 
        geom_bar(position = "fill") + 
        theme_classic() + 
        theme(legend.position = "bottom"), 
    
    labels = "AUTO", 
    ncol = 2
)
```

## categorical ~ numerical

We have only a handful of numerical variables. Since our main outcome is RT-PCR, we will find summary measures grouped by `rt_pcr_pos_neg`. 

```{r}
covid_processed %>% 
    group_by(rt_pcr_pos_neg) %>% 
    summarize(mean_age = mean(patient_age, na.rm = TRUE), 
              sd_age = sd(patient_age, na.rm = TRUE), 
              median_time = mean(time_onset_test, na.rm = TRUE), 
              q1_time = quantile(time_onset_test, probs = 0.25, na.rm = TRUE), 
              q3_time = quantile(time_onset_test, probs = 0.75, na.rm = TRUE))

plot_grid(
    covid_processed %>% 
        ggplot(aes(factor(rt_pcr_pos_neg), patient_age, fill = factor(rt_pcr_pos_neg))) +
        geom_boxplot() + 
        theme_classic() + 
        theme(legend.position = "bottom"), 
        
    covid_processed %>% 
        filter(time_onset_test >= 0 & time_onset_test <= 30) %>% 
        ggplot(aes(factor(rt_pcr_pos_neg), time_onset_test, fill = factor(rt_pcr_pos_neg))) +
        geom_boxplot() +
        theme_classic() + 
        theme(legend.position = "bottom")
)

```

## numerical ~ numerical

```{r}
covid_processed %>% 
    summarise(correlation = cor(patient_age, time_onset_test, use = "complete.obs"))

covid_processed %>% 
    ggplot(aes(patient_age, time_onset_test)) +
    geom_point() + 
    theme_classic()
```

We notice that `time_onset_test` has a skewed distribution. Since correlation depends on the assumption of linear association, let's transform this variable by converting to log scale. 

```{r}
covid_processed %>% 
    ggplot(aes(patient_age, time_onset_test)) +
    geom_point() + 
    scale_y_log10() + 
    ylab("log10 of time from onset to test") + 
    theme_classic()
```

## Population Pyramid graph 

Another useful way of visualizating demographic data is to create a population pyramid. This graph can compare different age distributions across male and female. 

* age in intervals on y-axis 
* sex in x-axis 


```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
covid_processed %>%
    ggplot(aes(patient_age, fill = patient_sex)) +
    # female histogram
    geom_histogram(data = covid_processed %>% filter(patient_sex == "Female"),
                 breaks = seq(0, 100, 5),
                 colour = "white") +
    # male histogram
    geom_histogram(data = covid_processed %>% filter(patient_sex == "Male"),
                 breaks = seq(0, 100, 5),
                 mapping = aes(y = ..count..*(-1)),
                 colour = "white") +
    ylab("Number") +
    xlab("Patient's age in years") +
    # adjust counts-axis scale
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-600, 600),
                     breaks = seq(-600, 600, 100),
                     labels = abs(seq(-600, 600, 100))) +
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 100), 
                       breaks = seq(0, 100, 5), 
                     labels = abs(seq(0, 100, 5))) +
    # flip the X and Y axes
    coord_flip() +
    scale_fill_discrete(name = "Sex") +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Creating another version of Table 1 stratified by outcome variable 

Our outcome of interest here is `rt_pcr_pos_neg`. So let's stratify all variables and see what we can make sense of it. 

For this purpose, we use `tbl_summary` function from the `gtsummary` package. Here we add a few more options to make the table look nice. 

```{r}
covid_processed %>% 
    ## convert to readable values for rt_pcr_pos_neg
    mutate(rtpcr = ifelse(rt_pcr_pos_neg == 1, "Yes", "No")) %>% 
    tbl_summary(
        by = rtpcr, 
        statistic = list(
            time_onset_test ~ "{median} ({p25}, {p75})" # "{mean} ({sd})" 
        ), 
        digits = all_continuous() ~ 1,
        label = list(
            patient_age = "Age in years", 
            patient_sex = "Sex", 
            p_province = "Province", 
            symptom_status = "Symptomatic", 
            symp_number = "Number of symptoms", 
            vaccine_status = "Vaccination status", 
            dose_num = "Number of doses received", 
            case_contact = "History of contact with case", 
            travel_hist = "Travel history", 
            rt_pcr_pos_neg = "RT-PCR", 
            time_onset_test = "Time in days from onset to test"
        ),

## Linear regression 

While our main outcome is RT-PCR positivity, we will use `time_onset_test` for the purpose of demonstrating linear regression. Let's see what factors predict time from onset of symptoms to testing. 

### Running a simple linear model 

Let's start with a simple linear regression which contains an outcome and only one predictor `patient_age`.

```{r}
m1 <- lm(time_onset_test ~ patient_age, data = covid_processed)
m1
```

As you can see, time from onset to testing slowly increases at a rate of 0.008351 day with one year increment in patient's age.

Let's see how well this model fits.  

```{r}
summary(m1)
```

It seems this model with age as predictor is not doing well. 

### Visualizing linear relationships 

Let's plot this relationship. 

```{r}
covid_processed %>% 
    ggplot(aes(patient_age, time_onset_test)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
    theme_classic()
```

You can see clearly from this graph that the relationship is not linear, especially because time_onset_test has a skewed distribution. 

Let's see if we can make this work by converting it to log scale. 

```{r}
covid_processed %>% 
    ggplot(aes(patient_age, time_onset_test)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
    scale_y_log10() +
    theme_classic()
```

It still doesn't fit well. 

We have already discussed that time_onset_test has invalid or irrelevant values. We can try the regression by removing these values. 

```{r}
covid_processed %>% 
    filter(time_onset_test >= 0 & time_onset_test <= 30) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(patient_age, time_onset_test)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
    theme_classic()
```

It seems like there is a really weak association between them but still the model is not that good. 

Let's check some values of model fitness.

```{r}
m2 <- covid_processed %>% 
    filter(time_onset_test >= 0 & time_onset_test <= 30) %>% 
    lm(time_onset_test ~ patient_age, data = .)
summary(m2)
```

Now, we are getting something. WIth one year increase in age, it takes additional 0.04 day (almost one hour) longer. But only 1.44 % (R-squared value) is explained by `patient_age`.

Let's do the `autoplot` from `ggfortify` package.

```{r}
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(m2)
```

* Figure 1: Residuals versus Fitted 
    - although residual values are stable across fitted values, they are not normally distributed. 
* Figure 2: Normal Q-Q plot 
    - outcome is not normally distributed. 
* Figure 3: Scale-Location
    - seems like a minor heteroskedascity issue (equal variance)
* Figure 4: Residuals versus leverage
    - several leverage and influential points 
    
All these points indicate our linear model `m2` is still a poor fit. 

Let's do log transformation for the second time. 
To convert on log scale, we need to be careful with zero. So we remove time of zero from this dataset as well. 

```{r}
m3 <- covid_processed %>% 
    ## remove zero values here 
    filter(time_onset_test > 0 & time_onset_test <= 30) %>% 
    lm(log(time_onset_test) ~ patient_age, data = .)
summary(m3)
autoplot(m3)
```

In terms of model fit, it's not doing any better. 
But if you look at the residuals values or Figure 1, it pretty much center around 0 and less skewed now. But you can see patterns in these figures, still meaning a poor fit. 

**Things to consider**

* removing observations reduces sample size hence power to reject null hypothesis. 
* transforming data might complicate interpretation
* consider using other models

### Adding a categorical variable

Let's add `patient_sex`. We remove missing values. In fact, if data quality is good, there shouldn't be missing values in `sex`. 

```{r}
covid_processed %>% 
    filter(time_onset_test >= 0 & time_onset_test <= 30) %>% 
    filter(!is.na(patient_sex)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(patient_age, time_onset_test)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
    facet_grid(cols = vars(patient_sex)) + 
    theme_classic()
```

Male older patients seem to be taking longer time. 

Let's run the model. 

```{r}
m4 <- covid_processed %>% 
    filter(time_onset_test > 0 & time_onset_test <= 30) %>% 
    lm(log(time_onset_test) ~ patient_age + patient_sex, data = .)
summary(m4)
```

Adding `patient_sex` to the model seems to reduce the model performance (look at adjusted R-squared). To conclude, `patient_sex` is not a significant predictor for `time_onset_test`. 

## Logistic regression 

```{r}
logm1 <- glm(rt_pcr_pos_neg ~ patient_age, data = covid_processed, 
             family = binomial)
logm1 
summary(logm1)
```

It seems like age is a good predictor of RT PCR positivity. But is it? 

With one year increase, the log odds of being PCR positive rises by 0.010297. Let's convert this to odds ratio which we can comprehend more easily. 

```{r}
exp(0.010297)
```

So there is only 1% chance of being PCR positive with age increment. 
AIC value for this model is `3747.8`. 

### Add a categorical variable 

```{r}
logm2 <- glm(rt_pcr_pos_neg ~ patient_age + patient_sex, data = covid_processed, 
             family = binomial)
summary(logm2)
```

The slope value of `patient_age` barely changes and it is highly significant. But adding patient_sex to the model increases AIC value which is not good. So it is statistically useless to the model. 

Let's try `symptom_status`. 

```{r}
logm3 <- glm(rt_pcr_pos_neg ~ symptom_status, data = covid_processed, 
             family = binomial)
summary(logm3)
exp(0.61246)
```

So patients who shows symptoms were 1.84 times more likely to have a PCR test positive. But AIC value increases to 3814.1. 

### Things to consider

* how do you know which variables to add in the model? 
    - AIC, BIC, or likelihood ratio test 
* interaction terms or any confounding variables
* how to handle missing values

# Creating tables for regression models

We will use another function `tbl_regression` from the same `gtsummary` package.


## Linear regression 

```{r}
lm_final <- covid_processed %>% 
    lm(time_onset_test ~ patient_age + patient_sex + p_province + 
           symptom_status + vaccine_status + case_contact, data = .)
summary(lm_final)
tbl_regression(lm_final, 
                label = list(
            patient_age = "Age in years", 
            patient_sex = "Sex", 
            p_province = "Province", 
            symptom_status = "Symptomatic", 
            vaccine_status = "Vaccination status", 
            case_contact = "History of contact with case"
               )) %>%
        bold_labels() %>% 
        add_global_p() %>%  # add global p-value 
        bold_p(t = 0.10) %>% # bold p-value 
        italicize_levels() 
```

No significant predictors in this model! This is expected. 

\newpage

## Logistic regression 

First we categorize `patient_age` for better interpretability. 

```{r}
covid_processed <- covid_processed %>% 
    mutate(age_grp = case_when(
        patient_age < 18 ~ "18 years", 
        patient_age >= 18 & patient_age < 60 ~ "18-59 years", 
        patient_age >= 60 ~ "60+ years"
    )) 
logm_final <- glm(rt_pcr_pos_neg ~ age_grp + p_province + 
                      symptom_status + vaccine_status + 
                      case_contact, 
                  data = covid_processed,
                  family = binomial)
summary(logm_final)

tbl_regression(logm_final, 
               exponentiate = TRUE, 
               label = list(
            age_grp = "Age categories", 
            p_province = "Province", 
            symptom_status = "Symptomatic", 
            vaccine_status = "Vaccination status", 
            case_contact = "History of contact with case", 
            rt_pcr_pos_neg = "RT-PCR"
               )) %>%
        bold_labels() %>% 
        add_global_p() %>%  # add global p-value 
        bold_p(t = 0.10) %>% # bold p-value 
        italicize_levels() 
```

Patients who resided outside EHP are less likely to test positive and those symptomatic patients were more likely to have a positive PCR test.
